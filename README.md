1. *Data Collection* – Retail sales dataset (CSV format).  
2. *Data Cleaning* – Handle missing values, normalize dates, format categories.  
3. *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)* – Identify patterns, seasonality, and top contributors.  
4. *Modeling* –  
   - Time Series: ARIMA / Prophet  
   - ML Regression: Random Forest / XGBoost  
5. *Visualization* – Interactive dashboard with Streamlit & Plotly.  
6. *Business Insights* – Translate results into recommendations (e.g., which region needs restocking).
